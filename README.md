## Overview

Week 5 marks the transition from learning individual Java concepts to building cohesive, working systems. Each mini-project demonstrates practical applications of object-oriented programming, collections, file handling, and exception management.

---

## Projects Covered

### Project 1: Bank Management System
- Demonstrates use of inheritance, interfaces, and abstract classes
- Implements core banking operations like deposit, withdrawal, and account management

### Project 2: Student Grade Tracker
- Uses file input/output to store and retrieve student records
- Applies Map and List collections to organize and compute grades

### Project 3: File Encryption/Decryption Tool
- Performs byte-level file reading and writing
- Implements a basic encryption algorithm using character/key shifting logic

### Project 4: E-commerce Price Tracker
- Parses product data from files
- Tracks and compares price changes using OOP principles and encapsulation

### Project 5: Address Book Management
- Provides features to add, update, delete, and search contact entries
- Uses serialization for data persistence

---

## Tools and Technologies

- Java SE 8 or higher
- File handling: `FileReader`, `FileWriter`, `BufferedReader`, `ObjectInputStream`, `ObjectOutputStream`
- Collections Framework: `List`, `Map`, `Set`
- Java Stream API
- Basic Java I/O and exception handling

## How to Use This Repository

Each subfolder corresponds to a specific mini-project. Inside each project folder, you will find:
- Source code files with appropriate structure
- A `Main` class to run and test the project
- README or comments to guide implementation details

You are encouraged to run the code, explore the logic, and enhance the projects with additional features to deepen your learning.
